property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If

package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

buffer manually.

If you run into issues, use `\\[flycheck-verify-setup]' to get help.

Flycheck supports many languages out of the box, and many
additional ones are available on MELPA.  Adding new ones is very
easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and
request features at URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck'.

Flycheck displays its status in the mode line.  In the default
configuration, it looks like this:

`FlyC'     This buffer has not been checked yet.
`FlyC*'    Flycheck is running.  Expect results soon!
`FlyC:0'   Last check resulted in no errors and no warnings.
`FlyC:3|5' This buffer contains three errors and five warnings.
           Use `\\[flycheck-list-errors]' to see the list.
`FlyC-'    Flycheck doesn't have a checker for this buffer.

You may also see the following icons:
`FlyC!'    The checker crashed.
`FlyC.'    The last syntax check was manually interrupted.
`FlyC?'    The checker did something unexpected, like exiting with 1
           but returning no errors.

(fn &optional ARG)" t) (autoload 'flycheck-define-error-level "flycheck" "Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

(fn LEVEL &rest PROPERTIES)") (function-put 'flycheck-define-error-level 'lisp-indent-function 1) (autoload 'flycheck-define-command-checker "flycheck" "Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Some checkers that support reading from standard input have
     a separate flag to indicate the name of the file whose
     contents are being passed on standard input (typically
     `stdin-filename').  In that case, use the `(option)' form in
     `:command' to pass the value of variable `buffer-file-name'
     when the current buffer has a file name (that is,
     use `option \"--stdin-file-name\" buffer-file-name').

     For buffers not backed by files, checkers that support input
     on stdin typically report a file name like `-' or `<stdin>'.
     Make sure your error parser or patterns expect these file
     names (for example, use `(or \"<stdin>\" (file-name))') or
     call `flycheck-remove-error-file-names' in a custom
     `:error-filter'.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx

   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-or-right-other-corner'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
10.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
20. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR, TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR will let redisplay put the terminal
cursor in a non-selected frame, which is useful when use
vertico-posframe like package in tty.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other application
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a

This macro provides a compact way to write short `lambda' expressions.
It expands to a `lambda' expression, which calls the function FN with
arguments BODY and returns its value.  The arguments of the `lambda'
expression are derived from symbols found in BODY.

Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which appears in an unquoted part
of BODY, specifies a mandatory argument.  Each symbol from `&1' through
`&9', which appears in an unquoted part of BODY, specifies an optional
argument.  The symbol `&*' specifies extra (`&rest') arguments.

The shorter symbol `%' can be used instead of `%1', but using both in
the same expression is not allowed.  Likewise `&' can be used instead
of `&1'.  These shorthands are not recognized in function position.

To support binding forms that use a vector as VARLIST (such as `-let'
from the `dash' package), argument symbols are also detected inside of
vectors.

The space between `##' and FN can be omitted because `##' is read-syntax
for the symbol whose name is the empty string.  If you prefer you can
place a space there anyway, and if you prefer to not use this somewhat
magical symbol at all, you can instead use the alternative name `llama'.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a &optional _ c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)

which expands to:

Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the border

becomes:

Note how `_%3' and `_&6' are removed from the body, because their names

matching INITIAL-INPUT to select initially.  An integer stands
for the position of the desired candidate in the collection,

to sort candidates before displaying them.

an alist, the argument is a cons cell, otherwise it's a string.

MULTI-ACTION, when non-nil, is called instead of ACTION when
there are marked candidates. It takes the list of candidates as

pattern.

MATCHER is a function which can override how candidates are
filtered based on user input.  It takes a regex pattern and a
list of candidates, and returns the list of matching candidates.

candidates is updated after each input by calling COLLECTION.

EXTRA-PROPS is a plist that can be used to store
collection-specific session-specific data.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.
If the user did not specify any PREFIX or manually specify any KEYMAPS, general
will bind all MAPS in the prefix keymap corresponding to either PREFIX-MAP or
PREFIX-COMMAND instead of in the default keymap.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

`general-key' should be prefered over this whenever possible as it is simpler
and has saner functionality in many cases because it does not rely on
`unread-command-events' (e.g. \"C-h k\" will show the docstring of the command
to be simulated ; see the readme for more information). The main downsides of
`general-key' are that it cannot simulate a command followed by keys or
subsequent commands, and which-key does not currently work well with it when
simulating a prefix key/incomplete key sequence.

KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a
single command followed by a string of the key(s) to simulate after calling that
command. STATE should only be specified by evil users and should be a quoted
evil state. KEYMAP should not be quoted. Both STATE and KEYMAP aliases are
supported (but they have to be set when the macro is expanded). When neither
STATE or KEYMAP are specified, the key(s) will be simulated in the current
context.

If NAME is specified, it will replace the automatically generated function name.
NAME should not be quoted. If DOCSTRING is specified, it will replace the
automatically generated docstring.

Normally the generated function will look up KEY in the correct context to try
to match a command. To prevent this lookup, LOOKUP can be specified as nil.
Generally, you will want to keep LOOKUP non-nil because this will allow checking
the evil repeat property of matched commands to determine whether or not they
should be recorded. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for more
information about LOOKUP.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When a command name is specified and that command has been remapped (i.e. [remap
command] is currently bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the
original command unless REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- Prefix arguments are supported
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a named command and keys
- The user can simulate an incomplete key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function. By
default, `cl-gensym' is used to prevent name clashes (e.g. allows the user to
create multiple different commands using `self-insert-command' as the
FALLBACK-COMMAND without explicitly specifying NAME to manually prevent
clashes).

DECLARATIONS may be a single declaration or a list of declarations.
Each declaration is either a child, parent, or group.

A child declaration must have:

  - a name
  - a :keys string
  - a template type
  - a target
  - a template

and may also have:

  - hook functions defined with the hook keywords
  - contexts declared via the :contexts keyword
  - additional KEY VAL arguments

A parent declaration must have:

  - a name
  - a :keys string
  - a list of :children

and may also have additional properties inherited by its children.

A group is a special kind of parent declaration.
Its children inherit its properties.
It is not added to the template selection menu.
Its name must be the :group keyword.
It may optionally have a descriptive string for the value of :group.
It must not have a :keys value.

  (doct \\='((\"Work\" :keys \"w\" :file \"~/org/work.org\" :children
         ((:group \"Clocked\" :clock-in t :children
                  ((\"Call\" :keys \"p\" :template \"* Phone call with %?\")
                   (\"Meeting\" :keys \"m\" :template \"* Meeting with %?\")))
          (\"Browsing\" :keys \"b\" :template \"* Browsing %x\")))))

Returns:

  ((\"w\" \"Work\")
   (\"wp\" \"Call\" entry
    (file \"~/org/work.org\") \"* Phone call with %?\" :clock-in t)
   (\"wm\" \"Meeting\"    entry
    (file \"~/org/work.org\") \"* Meeting with %?\"    :clock-in t)
   (\"wb\" \"Browsing\"   entry (file \"~/org/work.org\") \"* Browsing %x\"))

Inherited Properties
====================

A child inherits its ancestors' properties.
It may optionally override an inherited property by specifying that property
directly.
For example, considering:

  (doct \\='((\"Grandparent\" :keys \"g\"
              :file \"example.org\"
              :children (\"Parent\" :keys \"p\"
                         :children (\"Child\" :keys \"c\")))))

The \"Child\" template inherits its :file property from the \"Grandparent\"
declaration.
The \"Parent\" declaration could override this value:

  (doct \\='((\"Grandparent\" :keys \"g\"
              :file \"example.org\"
              :children (\"Parent\" :keys \"p\"
                         :file \"overridden.org\"
                         :children (\"Child\" :keys \"c\")))))

And the \"Child\" would have its :file property set to \"overridden.org\".

Name & Keys
===========

Every declaration must define a name.
Unless it is a group, it must also define a :keys value.
The name is the first value in the declaration.
The :keys keyword defines the keys to access the template from the capture menu.

  (doct \\='((\"example\" :keys \"e\"...)))

  returns:

  ((\"e\" \"example\"...))

Type
====

The :type keyword defines the template's entry type and accepts the following
symbols:

  - entry
    An Org node with a headline.
    The template becomes a child of the target entry or a top level entry.

  - item
    A plain list item, placed in the first plain list at the target location.

  - checkitem
    A checkbox item.
    Same as plain list item only it uses a different default template.

  - table-line
    A new line in the first table at target location.

  - plain
    Text inserted as is.

`doct-default-entry-type' defines the entry type when the :type keyword is not
provided.

For example, with `doct-default-entry-type' set to entry (the default):

  (doct \\='((\"example\"
              :keys \"e\"
              :type entry
              :file \"\")))

  and:

  (doct \\='((\"example\"
              :keys \"e\"
              :file \"\")))

  both return:

  ((\"e\" \"example\" entry (file \"\") nil))

Target
======

The target defines the location of the inserted template text.

The first keyword declared in the following group exclusively sets the target.
The :file keyword is not necessary for these.

  - :id \"id of existing Org entry\"
    File as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry
    (see `org-id-get-create')

  - :clock t
    File to the currently clocked entry

  - :here t
    The position of point when `org-capture' is called

  - :function (lambda () ;visit file and move point to desired location...)
    This keyword is exclusive when used without the :file keyword.
    It is responsible for finding the proper file and location to insert the
    capture item.
    If :file defines a target file, then the function is only responsible for
    moving point to the desired location within that file.

  (doct \\='((\"example\"
              :keys \"e\"
              :type entry
              :clock t
              ;;ignored because :clock is first
              :function (lambda () (ignore))
              ;;also ignored
              :id \"1\")))

  returns:

  ((\"e\" \"example\" entry (clock) nil))

The :file keyword defines the target file for the capture template.

  (doct ... :file \"/path/to/target.org\")

It may be:

  - a string:

  (doct ... :file \"/path/to/target.org\")
  ;;empty string defaults to `org-default-notes-file'
  (doct ... :file \"\")

  - a function:

  ;;lambda
  (doct ... :file (lambda () (concat (read-string \"Capture Path: \") \".org\")))
  ;;or a function symbol
  (doct ... :file my/get-file-path)

  - or a variable:

  (doct ... :file my/file-path)

The following keywords refine the target file location:

  - :headline \"node headline\"
    File under unique heading in target file.

  - :olp (\"Level 1 heading\" \"Level 2 heading\"...)
    Define the full outline in the target file.

  - :datetree nil|t
    Requires use of the :file keyword.
    If :datetree has a non-nil value, create a date tree for today's date.
    If :olp is given, the date tree is added under that heading path.
    Use a non-nil :time-prompt property to prompt for a different date.
    Set the :tree-type property to the symbol `week` to make a week tree
    instead of the default month tree.

  - :regexp \"regexp describing location\"
    File to entry matching regexp in target file

  - :function location-finding-function
    If used in addition to the :file keyword, the value should be a function
    that finds the desired location in that file.
    If used as an exclusive keyword (see above), the function must locate
    both the target file and move point to the desired location.


Template
========

The :template keyword defines the template for creating the capture item.
It may be either a string, list of strings, or a function.
doct joins the list with new lines.
A function must return the template text.

  (doct \\='((... :template (\"Test\" \"One\" \"Two\"))))

  returns:

  ((... \"Test\\nOne\\nTwo\"))

The :template-file keyword defines a file containing the text of the template.

The first keywords declared overrides any additional template declarations.

Additional Options
==================

Key-value pairs define additional options.

  (doct \\='((... :immediate-finish t)))

  returns:

  ((... :immediate-finish t))

see `org-capture-templates' for a full list of additional options.

Custom data
===========

doct stores unrecognized keywords on the template's `org-capture-plist' as
members of the doct-custom plist. This makes a template's metadata accessible
during capture. See \"%{KEYWORD} Expansion\" below for detail on using that
data.

The :custom keyword accepts a plist.
The doct-custom plist stores its elements.
This is only necessary if you wish to use a keyword which doct already uses.
For example:
  (doct \\='((\"Music Gear\" :keys \"m\" :file \"\"
           :custom (:keys \"Moog\")))

returns:

  (\"m\" \"Music Gear\" entry (file \"\") nil :doct-custom (:keys \"Moog\"))

Children
========

The :children keyword defines a parent's children.
Its value may be a single declaration or a list of declarations.
The parent's :keys prefix each child's :keys.

  (doct \\='((\"parent\" :keys \"p\"
              :children
              ((\"child\" :keys \"c\"
                :children
                ((\"grandchild\" :keys \"g\"
                  :file \"\"
                  :type plain
                  :template \"test\")))))))

  returns:

  ((\"p\" \"parent\")
   (\"pc\" \"child\")
   (\"pcg\" \"grandchild\" plain (file \"\") \"test\"))

%{KEYWORD} Expansion
======================

A declaration :template may include a keyword's value during capture.
The syntax is similar to other, built-in \"%-escapes\":

  %{KEYWORD}

will insert the value declared with :KEYWORD in the template.
For example, with:

  (doct \\='((\"Parent\" :keys \"p\"
           :file \"\"
           :template \"* %{todo-state} %?\"
           :children ((\"One\" :keys \"1\" :todo-state \"TODO\")
                      (\"Two\" :keys \"2\" :todo-state \"IDEA\")))))

Each child  has its :todo-state value expanded in the inherited :template.

Values should be strings, functions or nil.

  (doct \\='((\"%{string}\" :keys \"s\" :type plain :file \"\"
           :string \"string\"
           :template \"%{string}\")))

Is replaced with \"string\".

  (doct \\='((\"%{fn}\" :keys \"f\" :type plain :file \"\"
           :fn (lambda () \"string returned from function\")
           :template \"%{fn}\")))

Is replaced with \"string returned from function\".

  (doct \\='((\"%{nil}\" :keys \"f\" :type plain :file \"\"
           :nil nil
           :template \"%{nil}\")))

Is replaced with the empty string \"\".

Custom keywords take precedence over other declaration keywords.
For example, with:

  (doct \\='((\"Music Gear\" :keys \"m\" :file \"\" :type plain
           :custom (:keys \"Moog\")
           :template \"%{keys}\")))

The \"Music Gear\" template expands to \"Moog\" instead of \"m\".
Nil values expand to an empty string.

Hooks
=====

Adding the following keywords in a declaration adds its value to the appropriate
`org-capture' hook. The value may be a function or a variable.

  - :hook
    `org-capture-mode-hook'
  - :prepare-finalize
    `org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook'
  - :before-finalize
    `org-capture-before-finalize-hook'
  - :after-finalize
    `org-capture-after-finalize-hook'

For example:

  (doct \\=`((\"example\"
           :keys \"e\"
           :file \"\"
           :hook ,(defun my/fn ()
                   (ignore)))))

runs my/fn during `org-capture-mode-hook' when selecting template \"example\".

Contexts
========

The :contexts keyword defines contextual rules for a template.
Its value may be a single contextual rule or a list of rules.
The following keywords are available to create contextual rules:

  - :in-buffer regexp
    Show template when REGEXP matches the current buffer's name.

    (doct \\='((\"Only in *scratch*\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:in-buffer \"^*scratch*$\")))))

  - :unless-buffer regexp
    Show template unless REGEXP matches the current buffer's name.

    (doct \\='((\"Except in *scratch*\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:unless-buffer \"^*scratch*$\")))))

  - :in-file regexp
    Show template when REGEXP matches the current buffer's file name.

    (doct \\='((\"Only in work.org\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:in-file \"work\\.org$\")))))

  - :unless-file regexp
    Show template unless REGEXP matches the current buffer's file name.

    (doct \\='((\"Except in work.org\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:unless-file \"work\\.org$\")))))

  - :in-mode regexp
    Show template when REGEXP matches the current buffer's major mode.

    (doct \\='((\"Only in org-mode\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:in-mode \"org-mode\")))))

  - :unless-mode regexp
    Show template unless REGEXP matches the current buffer's major mode.

    (doct \\='((\"Except in org-mode\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:unless-mode \"org-mode\")))))

  - :when condition
    Show template when condition evaluates to a non-nil value.
    Condition may be a function or a single form.

    (doct \\='((\"Show when my/predicate-p returns t\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:when my/predicate-p)))))

    (doct \\='((\"1/3 chance of showing\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:when (= 2 (random 3)))))))

  - :unless condition
    Show template when condition evaluates to a nil value.
    Condition may be a function or a single form.

    (doct \\='((\"Show when my/predicate-p returns nil\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:unless my/predicate-p)))))

    (doct \\='((\"2/3 chance of showing\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts ((:unless (= 2 (random 3)))))))

  - :function
    Show template when function returns non-nil.
    The function is not passed any arguments.

    (doct \\='((\"Between 9AM and 5PM\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
             :contexts
             ((:function (lambda ()
                           (<= 9
                               (string-to-number (format-time-string \"%H\"))
                               17)))))))

Adding :keys to a rule does the same as above, but remaps the template's keys to
the template with keys matching the :keys string. For example:

  (doct \\='((\"In *scratch* remapped to t, else use original template\"
           :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
           :contexts ((:unless-buffer \"^\\*scratch\\*$\" :keys \"n\")
                      (:in-buffer     \"^\\*scratch\\*$\" :keys \"t\")))))

Rule keywords, spare :function, :when, and :unless may also take a list of
strings for their values.

  (doct \\='((\"Only in org-mode or emacs-lisp-mode\" :keys \"n\" :file \"\"
           :contexts ((:in-mode (\"org-mode\" \"emacs-lisp-mode\"))))))


Disabling Templates
===================

Setting the :disabled keyword to t disables a template.
The template's declaration is not error checked.
This can be useful if you don't have the time to deal with an error right away.
For example:

  (doct \\='((:group \"All\" :file \"\" :children
                  ((:group \"Enabled\" :children
                           ((\"One\"   :keys \"1\")
                            (\"Two\"   :keys \"2\")
                            (\"Three\" :keys \"3\")))
                   (:group \"Disabled\" :disabled t :children
                           ((\"Four\" :keys 4)
                            (\"Five\" :keys 5)
                            (\"Six\"  :keys 6)))))))

returns:

  ((\"1\" \"One\"   entry (file \"\") nil)
   (\"2\" \"Two\"   entry (file \"\") nil)
   (\"3\" \"Three\" entry (file \"\") nil))

Normally template \"Four\" would error because its :keys are not a string.

BODY is the same as that in `defhydra', withe the following
pretty hydra specific ones:

  - `:separator' a single char used to generate the separator
    line.

  - `:title' a string that's added to the beginning of the
    docstring as a title of the hydra.

  - `:formatter' a function that takes the generated docstring
    and return a decorated one.  It can be used to further
    customize the hydra docstring.

  - `:quit-key' a key of list of keys for quitting the hydra.
    When specified, invisible head(s) are created with the
    specified keys for quitting the hydra.

HEADS-PLIST is a plist of columns of hydra heads.  The keys of
the plist should be column names.  The values should be lists of
hydra heads.  Each head has exactly the same syntax as that of
`defhydra', except hint is required for the head to appear in the
docstring.  The following additional options are supported:

  - `:width' the max width of a dynamic hint, used to calculate
    the final width of the entire column.  It is ignored when the
    hint is a string.

  - `:toggle' when specified, it makes the head a toggle and adds
    an indicator to the end of the hint for the status of the
    toggle.  The value of this option can be a symbol, an s-exp

       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If you call `async-send' from a child process, the message will
be also passed to the FINISH-FUNC.  You can test RESULT to see if
it is a message by using `async-message-p'.  If nil, it means
this is the final result.  Example of the FINISH-FUNC:

    (lambda (result)
      (if (async-message-p result)
          (message \"Received a message from child process: %s\" result)
        (message \"Async process done, result: %s\" result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.
The customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' determine the exact circumstances
whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

By default, `flymake-mode' doesn't override the \\[next-error] command, but

mechanisms that often), it can be useful to put something like
the following in your init file:

  (setq next-error-function \\='flymake-goto-next-error)

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
by setting properties `flymake-overlay-control', `flymake-bitmap'
and `flymake-severity' on the symbols of diagnostic types (like
`:error', `:warning' and `:note').

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer.  The commands

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a
directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If `consult-grep'
is called interactively with a prefix argument, the user can specify the
directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must
be separated by comma in the minibuffer, since they are read via
`completing-read-multiple'.  By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.  Otherwise
the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a
double prefix argument (twice `C-u') the user is asked for a project, if
not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

For instance, the following code

  (let-alist alist
    (if (and .title.0 .body)
        .body

essentially expands to

If you nest `let-alist' invocations, the inner one can't access
the variables of the outer one.  You can, however, access alists
inside the original alist by using dots inside the symbol, as
displayed in the example above.

To refer to a non-`let-alist' variable starting with a dot in BODY, use
two dots instead of one.  For example, in the following form `..foo'
refers to the variable `.foo' bound outside of the `let-alist':

    (let ((.foo 42)) (let-alist \\='((foo . nil)) ..foo))

Note that there is no way to differentiate the case where a key
is missing from when it is present, but its value is nil.  Thus,
the following form evaluates to nil:

uses external programs to highlight found matches via
image-processing, proceeding to the next match may be slow.

Therefore two isearch behaviours have been defined: Normal isearch and
batch mode.  The later one is a minor mode
(`pdf-isearch-batch-mode'), which when activated inhibits isearch
from stopping at and highlighting every single match, but rather
display them batch-wise.  Here a batch means a number of matches
currently visible in the selected window.

The kind of highlighting is determined by three faces
`pdf-isearch-match' (for the current match), `pdf-isearch-lazy'
(for all other matches) and `pdf-isearch-batch' (when in batch
mode), which see.

Colors may also be influenced by the minor-mode
